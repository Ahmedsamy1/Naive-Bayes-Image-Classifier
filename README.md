# Naive-Bayes-Image-Classifier

A linear image classifier that uses Naive Bayes model to classify hand-written digits.

- The code assumes that there is a directory which is named "Train", this directory to train the classifier. The directory contains hand-written digits from 0 to 9, and for each digit 240 images are present.

- The code also assumes that there is a directory which is named "Test" which contains testing Images that the mode hadn't seen. The code classifies those images and generates and saves the confusion matrix.
